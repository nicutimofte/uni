Develop an application in python that has the following functionalities:
1. Randomly creates possible solutions for your assigned problem (Random Candidate
Solution Generator) (25p).
2. Check if a candidate to the solution is indeed a viable solution (25p).
3. Assigns a measure of quality (a positive value) to a candidate solution - where zero
marks a correct one and, as the candidate is more and more farther from the correct
solution the number grows (Fitness Function) (25p).
4. For a sample set (of size n) of random generated solutions, the mean and the standard
deviation of their quality measures is computed (25p).
A set of n questions are available in order to develop an aptitude test, question i being
rated with p points. It is required to develop questionnaires having the total number of
i
questions between u and v and summarizing between x and y points.
