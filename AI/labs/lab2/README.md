 ## Jumping over cubes problem – solving techniques: DFS, GBFS
    
    Identify a descending path from the top of a pyramid built from 1+22+32+…+n2 cubes of
    same dimension, but with different associated scores, in such a way that the total score
    cumulated on the path would be maxim. The pyramid is build it such that one cube is placed
    over other 4 cubes – one quarter of the cube is over one (from the 4) below it. The descend
    from a level to another implies a jump from a cube ci
    from level i to a cube ci+1
    from level i+1 (the
    top cube is on level 1, the bottom cubes are on level n), the cube ci being over the cube ci+1.
