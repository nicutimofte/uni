# ASP.NET

Write a web application for managing food recipes. The application should maintain various information about a recipe in the database (i.e. author, name, type, the actual recipe etc.). The application should implement: recipes browsing, adding, removing and updating a recipe. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. recipe type), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
Your application must implement user authentication and ask the user to authenticate himself/herself prior to actually using the web application (based on an username and password saved in the database).
