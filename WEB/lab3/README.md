Develop a web page using only HTML and CSS that has the same design as the web page http://www.yahoo.com. For small portions of text of maximum 3 words (e.g. menu items) you may use whatever text you want, but for larger portions of text (e.g. paragraphs) use "Lorem ipsum" text (you may use the generator from http://www.lipsum.com). Also, you may use exactly one image file in your web page (no more and no less); this image is the subject of your own choice. Within this web page you should also implement tab-based navigation. You are not allowed to use any text, images or resources from the yahoo.com site. We are interested in the "tabbed-based navigation", which means that when you are over one tab the content should change. Please use the :hover selector!
