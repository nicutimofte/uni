filter entities based on various criteria
reports: e.g. find the most rented movie

## Lab 7-10: Angular 2, Spring, JPA (Hibernate)
- convert your project (Lab 2-4) to a web application 
- use Angular 2
- use Spring --- xml config forbidden
- use Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden
- log messages using SLF4J
-> for lab7: only one feature is enough - show the list of entities (e.g. clients)
-> for lab 10: all features (the iteration plan and specific and other requirements will be posted on the forum in the following weeks)
